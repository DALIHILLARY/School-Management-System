#### SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR KATIKAMU PRIMARY SCHOOL
###### (All Functions Implemented)
###### For a teacher to add marks:
###### He clicks a button "click to add marks",
###### He is prompted to select an excel sheet from the file directory containing marks to be added, in this case the excel sheet is named "Entering Marks Sheet.xlsx" provided in the project src files. However it contains records already in the database and these will be ignored by the system and it will add only the new records. Therefore the teacher is required to enter new records in format ['Student ID', 'Subject', 'Mark', 'Teacher ID'].
###### The system will add the new marks records only if the Student ID and Teacher ID used are for registered student and teacher respectively. Otherwise, they won't be added.
